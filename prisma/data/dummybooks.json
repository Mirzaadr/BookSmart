    "summary": "The Lean Startup by Eric Ries is a guide to building and managing startups in a way that maximizes innovation while minimizing wasted effort. The book introduces the concept of the “Lean Startup” methodology, which focuses on quickly turning ideas into products, testing them with real customers, and learning from their feedback to refine and improve. This approach helps entrepreneurs create successful businesses by avoiding long periods of untested development.\n\nA central idea of the book is the Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop. Startups should build a “minimum viable product” (MVP)—a simplified version of their idea that allows them to test assumptions quickly. By measuring how customers respond to the MVP, startups can learn what works and what doesn’t, enabling them to make informed decisions about whether to pivot (change direction) or persevere (continue improving the same idea). This process reduces the risk of investing time and money into a product that might fail in the market.\n\nThe Lean Startup methodology emphasizes the importance of continuous experimentation and validated learning. Entrepreneurs are encouraged to treat their ideas as hypotheses and to test them rigorously with data rather than assumptions. This scientific approach ensures that decisions are based on evidence, leading to better chances of success.\n\nAnother key aspect is the principle of “innovation accounting,” which focuses on measuring progress in terms of validated learning rather than vanity metrics like website traffic or social media likes. Startups should track meaningful metrics that reflect real customer engagement and satisfaction to ensure they are on the right path.\n\nOverall, The Lean Startup provides a roadmap for creating agile, customer-focused businesses. By focusing on rapid experimentation, data-driven decision-making, and constant iteration, entrepreneurs can navigate uncertainty, avoid unnecessary failures, and build products that truly meet the needs of their customers."

    "summary": "Atomic Habits by James Clear is a book about how small changes in daily habits can lead to significant transformations over time. Clear emphasizes that habits are the compound interest of self-improvement—tiny actions repeated consistently will eventually produce remarkable results. \n\nRather than focusing on massive overhauls, the book encourages readers to aim for a 1% improvement each day, as these incremental gains accumulate to create meaningful progress.\n\nThe book introduces the \"Four Laws of Behavior Change\" as a framework for building good habits and breaking bad ones. These laws are: make it obvious, make it attractive, make it easy, and make it satisfying. Clear explains how these principles can be applied to rewire habits by adjusting cues, cravings, responses, and rewards. For instance, placing a water bottle on your desk makes drinking water more obvious and accessible, increasing the likelihood of forming a healthy hydration habit.\n\nA key insight in the book is the role of identity in shaping habits. Clear argues that lasting change comes when you focus on who you want to become rather than what you want to achieve. For example, instead of saying, \"I want to read more,\" you could say, \"I am the type of person who loves learning.\" By aligning your habits with your identity, you create a sustainable foundation for growth.\n\nThe environment also plays a critical role in habit formation. Clear emphasizes the importance of designing your surroundings to make good habits easier and bad habits harder. Simple changes, like keeping healthy snacks visible or removing distractions from your workspace, can have a profound impact on your behavior.\n\nUltimately, Atomic Habits is a reminder that success is not about huge leaps but about the small, consistent steps we take every day. By focusing on systems and making intentional adjustments, anyone can create lasting, positive changes in their life."

Or they can do the most painful thing any Human or Drac has ever done—reach out and begin the new age of understanding that is struggling to be born..."

As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.\r\n\r\nThe result of more than ten years of planning, writing, and worldbuilding, The Way of Kings is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making.\r\n\r\nSpeak again the ancient oaths,\r\n\r\nLife before death.\r\nStrength before weakness.\r\nJourney before destination.\r\n\r\nand return to men the Shards they once bore.\r\n\r\nThe Knights Radiant must stand again.\r\n\r\n-From Cover Flap"

The mists are killing people and staying out much longer than they should. The Ashmounts are spewing more and more choking ash into the sky, burying the crops that everyone needs to eat to live.

He knows he will need his powerful demigod allies at his side, his trusty bronze sword Riptide, and…a ride from his mom.\r\n\r\nThe demigods rush to the rescue to find that Grover has made an important discovery: two powerful half-bloods whose parentage is unknown.

Along the way, they must face their most dangerous challenge yet: the chilling prophecy of the titan’s curse.",

Donald Barr has described it as \"a scrubbed morning world, and a ringing nightmare world...especially sunlit, and shadowed by perils very fundamental, of a peculiarly uncompounded darkness.\" The story of this world is one of high and heroic adventure.

Oh, and did we mention that no one knows where Ra is exactly?\r\n\r\nNarrated in two different wisecracking voices, featuring a large cast of new and unforgettable characters, and with adventures spanning the globe, this second installment in the Kane Chronicles is nothing short of a thrill ride."

    "description": "In-depth, informative and entertaining, *The Annotated Sandman* is a fascinating look at the celebrated comic book series written by New York Times best-selling author Neil Gaiman.\r\n\r\n*The Sandman* is one of the most acclaimed titles in the history of comics. A rich blend of modern myth and dark fantasy in which contemporary fiction, historical drama and legend are seamlessly interwoven, The Sandman is also widely considered to be one of the most original and artistically ambitious comic books of the modern age. By the time it concluded in 1996, it had made significant contributions to the artistic maturity of comics as a whole and had become a pop culture phenomenon in its own right. Critics and readers alike agreed: The Sandman proved that comic books were not simply a genre but were instead a rich and unique medium combining both art and literature.\r\n\r\nNow, DC Comics is proud to present this literary classic in an all-new Annotated Edition format.

    "summary": "In-depth, informative and entertaining, *The Annotated Sandman* is a fascinating look at the celebrated comic book series written by New York Times best-selling author Neil Gaiman.\r\n\r\n*The Sandman* is one of the most acclaimed titles in the history of comics. A rich blend of modern myth and dark fantasy in which contemporary fiction, historical drama and legend are seamlessly interwoven, The Sandman is also widely considered to be one of the most original and artistically ambitious comic books of the modern age. By the time it concluded in 1996, it had made significant contributions to the artistic maturity of comics as a whole and had become a pop culture phenomenon in its own right. Critics and readers alike agreed: The Sandman proved that comic books were not simply a genre but were instead a rich and unique medium combining both art and literature.\r\n\r\nNow, DC Comics is proud to present this literary classic in an all-new Annotated Edition format. Edited with notes by Leslie S. Klinger, *The Annotated Sandman* is a page-by-page, panel-by-panel journey through every installment of *The Sandman*. Using the original comic book scripts and hours of conversations with Gaiman himself, Klinger presents a wealth of commentary, references, and hidden meanings that deepen and enrich our understanding of the acclaimed series.

Neither side has gained an advantage, and the threat of a betrayal by Dalinar's crafty ally Taravangian looms over every strategic move.\r\n\r\nNow, as new technological discoveries by Navani Kholin's scholars begin to change the face of the war, the enemy prepares a bold and dangerous operation. The arms race that follows will challenge the very core of the Radiant ideals, and potentially reveal the secrets of the ancient tower that was once the heart of their strength.\r\n\r\nAt the same time that Kaladin Stormblessed must come to grips with his changing role within the Knights Radiant, his Windrunners face their own problem: As more and more deadly enemy Fused awaken to wage war, no more honorspren are willing to bond with humans to increase the number of Radiants. Adolin and Shallan must lead the coalition’s envoy to the honorspren stronghold of Lasting Integrity and either convince the spren to join the cause against the evil god Odium, or personally face the storm of failure."

But now her father, the Mage Abhorsen, is missing, and to find him Sabriel must cross back into that world.\r\n\r\nThough her journey begins alone, she soon finds companions: Mogget, whose seemingly harmless feline form hides a powerful and perhaps malevolent spirit; and Touchstone, a young Charter Mage long imprisoned by magic, now free in body but still trapped by painful memories.\r\n\r\nWith threats on all sides and only each other to trust, the three must travel deep into the Old Kingdom, toward a battle that will pit them against the true forces of life and death, and bring Sabriel face-to-face with her own hidden destiny.\r\n\r\nA tale of dark secrets, deep love and dangerous magic, Sabriel introduces Garth Nix as an exceptional new talent."

He calls his sanctuary the Foundation.\r\n\r\nBut soon the fledgling Foundation finds itself at the mercy of corrupt warlords rising in the wake of the receding Empire.

Whether you’re new to the field or an experienced practitioner, you’ll come away with fresh insights each and every time. \r\n\r\nDave Thomas and Andy Hunt wrote the first edition of this influential book in 1999 to help their clients create better software and rediscover the joy of coding. These lessons have helped a generation of programmers examine the very essence of software development, independent of any particular language, framework, or methodology, and the Pragmatic philosophy has spawned hundreds of books, screencasts, and audio books, as well as thousands of careers and success stories. \r\n\r\nNow, 20 years later, this new edition re-examines what it means to be a modern programmer. Topics range from personal responsibility and career development to architectural techniques for keeping your code flexible and easy to adapt and reuse. All the old favorite topics are there, updated for this new world. And there's a bunch of new content, reflecting what we've learned in the intervening years. \r\n\r\nWhether you’re a new coder, an experienced programmer, or a manager responsible for software projects, use these lessons daily, and you’ll quickly see improvements in personal productivity, accuracy, and job satisfaction. You’ll learn skills and develop habits and attitudes that form the foundation for long-term success in your career. You’ll become a pragmatic programmer. \r\n\r\nThis audiobook is organized as a series of sections, each containing a series of topics. It is read by Anna Katarina; Dave and Andy (and a few other folks) jump in every now and then to give their take on things.",

    "description": "JavaScript is a powerful, object-based scripting language; JavaScript programs can be embedded directly into HTML web pages. When combined with the Document Object Model (DOM) defined by a web browser, JavaScript allows you to create Dynamic HTML (DHTML) content and interactive client-side web applications. JavaScript syntax is based on the popular programming languages C, C++, and Java, which makes it familiar and easy to learn for experienced programmers. At the same time, JavaScript is an interpreted scripting language, providing a flexible, forgiving environment in which new programmers can learn.\r\n\r\n*JavaScript: The Definitive Guide* provides a thorough description of the core JavaScript language and both the legacy and standard DOMs implemented in web browsers. The book includes sophisticated examples that show you how to handle common tasks such as validating form data, working with cookies, and creating portable DHTML animations. The book also contains detailed reference sections that cover the core JavaScript API, the legacy client-side API, and the W3C standard DOM API, documenting every JavaScript object, method, property, constructor, constant, function, and event handler in those APIs.\r\n\r\nThis fourth edition of the bestselling JavaScript book has been carefully updated to cover JavaScript 1.5 (ECMAScript Version 3). The book also provides complete coverage of the W3C DOM standard (Level 1 and Level 2), while retaining material on the legacy Level 0 DOM for backward compatibility.\r\n\r\n*JavaScript: The Definitive Guide* is a complete programmer's guide and reference manual for JavaScript.

    "summary": "JavaScript is a powerful, object-based scripting language; JavaScript programs can be embedded directly into HTML web pages. When combined with the Document Object Model (DOM) defined by a web browser, JavaScript allows you to create Dynamic HTML (DHTML) content and interactive client-side web applications. JavaScript syntax is based on the popular programming languages C, C++, and Java, which makes it familiar and easy to learn for experienced programmers. At the same time, JavaScript is an interpreted scripting language, providing a flexible, forgiving environment in which new programmers can learn.\r\n\r\n*JavaScript: The Definitive Guide* provides a thorough description of the core JavaScript language and both the legacy and standard DOMs implemented in web browsers. The book includes sophisticated examples that show you how to handle common tasks such as validating form data, working with cookies, and creating portable DHTML animations. The book also contains detailed reference sections that cover the core JavaScript API, the legacy client-side API, and the W3C standard DOM API, documenting every JavaScript object, method, property, constructor, constant, function, and event handler in those APIs.\r\n\r\nThis fourth edition of the bestselling JavaScript book has been carefully updated to cover JavaScript 1.5 (ECMAScript Version 3). The book also provides complete coverage of the W3C DOM standard (Level 1 and Level 2), while retaining material on the legacy Level 0 DOM for backward compatibility.\r\n\r\n*JavaScript: The Definitive Guide* is a complete programmer's guide and reference manual for JavaScript. It is particularly useful for developers working with the latest standards-compliant web browsers, such as Internet Explorer 6, Netscape 6, and Mozilla. HTML authors can learn how to use JavaScript to build dynamic web pages. Experienced programmers can quickly find the information they need to start writing sophisticated JavaScript programs.

    "description": "\"The computer world is like an intellectual Wild West, in which you can shoot anyone you wish with your ideas, if you're willing to risk the consequences. \" --from Hackers & Painters: Big Ideas from the Computer Age , by Paul Graham We are living in the computer age, in a world increasingly designed and engineered by computer programmers and software designers, by people who call themselves hackers. Who are these people, what motivates them, and why should you care? Consider these facts: Everything around us is turning into computers. Your typewriter is gone, replaced by a computer. Your phone has turned into a computer. So has your camera. Soon your TV will. Your car was not only designed on computers, but has more processing power in it than a room-sized mainframe did in 1970. Letters, encyclopedias, newspapers, and even your local store are being replaced by the Internet. Hackers & Painters: Big Ideas from the Computer Age , by Paul Graham, explains this world and the motivations of the people who occupy it. In clear, thoughtful prose that draws on illuminating historical examples, Graham takes readers on an unflinching exploration into what he calls \"an intellectual Wild West.\" The ideas discussed in this book will have a powerful and lasting impact on how we think, how we work, how we develop technology, and how we live. Topics include the importance of beauty in software design, how to make wealth, heresy and free speech, the programming language renaissance, the open-source movement, digital design, internet startups, and more.",

    "description": "Regular expressions are an extremely powerful tool for manipulating text and data. They are now standard features in a wide range of languages and popular tools, including Perl, Python, Ruby, Java, VB.NET and C# (and any language using the .NET Framework), PHP, and MySQL. If you don't use regular expressions yet, you will discover in this book a whole new world of mastery over your data. If you already use them, you'll appreciate this book's unprecedented detail and breadth of coverage. If you think you know all you need to know about regular expressions, this book is a stunning eye-opener. As this book shows, a command of regular expressions is an invaluable skill. Regular expressions allow you to code complex and subtle text processing that you never imagined could be automated. Regular expressions can save you time and aggravation. They can be used to craft elegant solutions to a wide range of problems. Once you've mastered regular expressions, they'll become an invaluable part of your toolkit. You will wonder how you ever got by without them. Yet despite their wide availability, flexibility, and unparalleled power, regular expressions are frequently underutilized. Yet what is power in the hands of an expert can be fraught with peril for the unwary. Mastering Regular Expressions will help you navigate the minefield to becoming an expert and help you optimize your use of regular expressions. Mastering Regular Expressions, Third Edition, now includes a full chapter devoted to PHP and its powerful and expressive suite of regular expression functions, in addition to enhanced PHP coverage in the central \"core\" chapters. Furthermore, this edition has been updated throughout to reflect advances in other languages, including expanded in-depth coverage of Sun's java.util.regex package, which has emerged as the standard Java regex implementation.Topics include: A comparison of features among different versions of many languages and tools, How the regular expression engine works, Optimization (major savings available here!), Matching just what you want, but not what you don't want, Sections and chapters on individual languages. Written in the lucid, entertaining tone that makes a complex, dry topic become crystal-clear to programmers, and sprinkled with solutions to complex real-world problems, Mastering Regular Expressions, Third Edition offers a wealth information that you can put to immediate use. - Publisher.\r\n\r\n<h2>Printing History</h2>\r\n<dl> \r\n<dt>January 1997</dt>\r\n<dd>First Edition.</dd> \r\n<dt>March 1997</dt>\r\n<dd>Minor Corrections.</dd> \r\n<dt>May 1997</dt>\r\n<dd>Minor Corrections.</dd> \r\n<dt>July 1997</dt>\r\n<dd>Minor Corrections.</dd> \r\n<dt>November 1997</dt>\r\n<dd>Minor Corrections.</dd> \r\n<dt>July 2002</dt>\r\n<dd>Second Edition.</dd> \r\n<dt>August 2006</dt>\r\n<dd>Third Edition.</dd> \r\n</dl>",

Over the past five years, authors Dustin Boswell and Trevor Foucher have analyzed hundreds of examples of \"bad code\" (much of it their own) to determine why they're bad and how they could be improved. Their conclusion? You need to write code that minimizes the time it would take someone else to understand it -- even if that someone else is you. This book focuses on basic principles and practical techniques you can apply every time you write code. Using easy-to-digest code examples from different languages, each chapter dives into a different aspect of coding, and demonstrates how you can make your code easy to understand. Simplify naming, commenting, and formatting with tips that apply to every line of code; Refine your program's loops, logic, and variables to reduce complexity and confusion; Attack problems at the function level, such as reorganizing blocks of code to do one task at a time; Write effective test code that is thorough and concise, as well as readable. - Publisher.",

Although it also does a good job of teaching the what and how of the language, Thinking in Java is definitely the thinking person’s choice in a Java book.”\r\n—Robert S. Stephenson \r\n\r\nAwards for Thinking in Java  \r\n - 2003 Software Development Magazine Jolt Award for Best Book\r\n - 2003 Java Developer’s Journal Reader’s Choice Award for Best Book\r\n       2001 JavaWorld Editor’s Choice Award for Best Book\r\n       2000 JavaWorld Reader’s Choice Award for Best Book\r\n       1999 Software Development Magazine Productivity Award\r\n       1998 Java Developer’s Journal Editor’s Choice Award for Best Book\r\n\r\n\r\nDownload seven free sample chapters from Thinking in Java, Fourth Edition.

Think about your phone, cameras, cars - everything - being automated and programmed by people who in their rush to accept the many benefits of the silicon chip, have abdicated their responsibility to make these products easy to use. The Inmates are Running the Asylum argues that, despite appearances, business executives are simply not the ones in control of the high-tech industry. They have inadvertently put programmers and engineers in charge, leading to products and processes that waste money, squander customer loyalty, and erode competitive advantage. Business executives have let the inmates run the asylum! In his book The Inmates Are Running the Asylum Alan Cooper calls for revolution - we need technology to work in the same way average people think - we need to restore the sanity. He offers a provocative, insightful and entertaining explanation of how talented people continuously design bad software-based products. More importantly, he uses his own work with companies big and small to show how to harness those talents to create products that will both thrill their users and grow the bottom line.",

I barely cover C# 1, and only cover the .NET Framework libraries and Common Language Runtime (CLR) when they're related to the language. This is a deliberate decision, and the result is quite a different book from most of the C# and .NET books I've seen. By assuming a reasonable amount of knowledge of C# 1, I avoid spending hundreds of pages covering material that I think most people already understand. This gives me much more room to expand on the details of C# 2, 3, and 4, which is what I hope you're reading the book for. I believe that many developers would be less frustrated with their work if they had a deeper connection with the language they're writing in. I know it sounds geeky in the extreme to talk about having a \"relationship\" with a programming language, but that's the best way I can describe it. This book is my attempt to help you achieve that sort of understanding, or deepen it further. It won't be enough on its own -- it should be a companion to your coding, guiding you and suggesting some interesting avenues to explore, as well as explaining why your code behaves the way it does. - Publisher.",

With his balding head, cardigan, and khakis, he seems to have come straight from Therapist Central Casting. Yet he will turn out to be anything but.\r\n\r\nAs Gottlieb explores the inner chambers of her patients’ lives — a self-absorbed Hollywood producer, a young newlywed diagnosed with a terminal illness, a senior citizen threatening to end her life on her birthday if nothing gets better, and a twenty-something who can’t stop hooking up with the wrong guys — she finds that the questions they are struggling with are the very ones she is now bringing to Wendell.\r\n\r\nWith startling wisdom and humor, Gottlieb invites us into her world as both clinician and patient, examining the truths and fictions we tell ourselves and others as we teeter on the tightrope between love and desire, meaning and mortality, guilt and redemption, terror and courage, hope and change.\r\n\r\nMaybe You Should Talk to Someone is rev­olutionary in its candor, offering a deeply per­sonal yet universal tour of our hearts and minds and providing the rarest of gifts: a boldly reveal­ing portrait of what it means to be human, and a disarmingly funny and illuminating account of our own mysterious lives and our power to transform them.\r\n([source](https://www.hmhbooks.com/shop/books/maybe-you-should-talk-to-someone/9781328663047))",

    "description": "\"From the New York Times bestselling author of The Talent Code comes a book that unlocks the secrets of highly successful groups and provides tomorrow's leaders with the tools to build a cohesive, motivated culture.  Where does great culture come from? How do you build and sustain it in your group, or strengthen a culture that needs fixing?     In The Culture Code, Daniel Coyle goes inside some of the world's most successful organizations--including Pixar, the San Antonio Spurs, and U.S. Navy'sSEAL Team Six--and reveals what makes them tick. He demystifies the culture-building process by identifying three key skills that generate cohesion and cooperation, and explains how diverse groups learn to function with a single mind. Drawing on examples that range from Internet retailer Zappos to the comedy troupe Upright Citizens Brigade to a daring gang of jewel thieves, Coyle offers specific strategies that trigger learning, spark collaboration, build trust, and drive positive change. Coyle unearths helpful stories of failure that illustrate what not to do, troubleshoots common pitfalls, and shares advice about reforming a toxic culture. Combining leading-edge science, on-the-ground insights from world-class leaders, and practical ideas for action, The Culture Code offers a roadmap for creating an environment where innovation flourishes, problems get solved, and expectations are exceeded.  Culture is not something you are--it's something you do. The Culture Code puts the power in your hands. No matter the size of the group or the goal, this book can teach you the principles of cultural chemistry that transform individuals into teams that can accomplish amazing things together.  Advance praise for The Culture Code   \"If you want to understand how successful groups work--the signals they transmit, the language they speak, the cues that foster creativity--you won't find a more essential guide than The Culture Code. This is a marvel of insight and practicality.\"--Charles Duhigg, New York Times bestselling author of The Power of Habit and Smarter Faster Better   \"I've been waiting years for someone to write this book--I've built it up in my mind into something extraordinary.

Daniel Coyle spent three years researching the question of what makes a successful group tick, visiting some of the world's most productive groups--including Pixar, Navy SEALs, Zappos, IDEO, and the San Antonio Spurs. Coyle discovered that high-performing groups relentlessly generate three key messages that enable them to excel: 1) Safety - we are connected. 2) Shared Risk - we are vulnerable together. 3) Purpose - we are part of the same story.

It can get us dancing to its beat. But the power of music goes much, much further. Indeed, music occupies more areas of our brain than language does–humans are a musical species.\r\n\r\nOliver Sacks’s compassionate, compelling tales of people struggling to adapt to different neurological conditions have fundamentally changed the way we think of our own brains, and of the human experience. In Musicophilia, he examines the powers of music through the individual experiences of patients, musicians, and everyday people–from a man who is struck by lightning and suddenly inspired to become a pianist at the age of forty-two, to an entire group of children with Williams syndrome who are hypermusical from birth; from people with “amusia,” to whom a symphony sounds like the clattering of pots and pans, to a man whose memory spans only seven seconds–for everything but music.\r\n\r\nOur exquisite sensitivity to music can sometimes go wrong: Sacks explores how catchy tunes can subject us to hours of mental replay, and how a surprising number of people acquire nonstop musical hallucinations that assault them night and day. Yet far more frequently, music goes right: Sacks describes how music can animate people with Parkinson’s disease who cannot otherwise move, give words to stroke patients who cannot otherwise speak, and calm and organize people whose memories are ravaged by Alzheimer’s or amnesia.\r\n\r\nMusic is irresistible, haunting, and unforgettable, and in Musicophilia, Oliver Sacks tells us why.\r\n\r\n([source][1])\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.oliversacks.com/books-by-oliver-sacks/musicophilia/",

    "description": "Nightline anchor Dan Harris embarks on an unexpected, hilarious, and deeply skeptical odyssey through the strange worlds of spirituality and self-help, and discovers a way to get happier that is truly achievable.\r\n\r\nAfter having a nationally televised panic attack on Good Morning America, Dan Harris knew he had to make some changes. A lifelong nonbeliever, he found himself on a bizarre adventure, involving a disgraced pastor, a mysterious self-help guru, and a gaggle of brain scientists. Eventually, Harris realized that the source of his problems was the very thing he always thought was his greatest asset: the incessant, insatiable voice in his head, which had both propelled him through the ranks of a hyper-competitive business and also led him to make the profoundly stupid decisions that provoked his on-air freak-out.\r\n\r\nWe all have a voice in our head. It’s what has us losing our temper unnecessarily, checking our email compulsively, eating when we’re not hungry, and fixating on the past and the future at the expense of the present. Most of us would assume we’re stuck with this voice – that there’s nothing we can do to rein it in – but Harris stumbled upon an effective way to do just that. It’s a far cry from the miracle cures peddled by the self-help swamis he met; instead, it’s something he always assumed to be either impossible or useless: meditation. After learning about research that suggests meditation can do everything from lower your blood pressure to essentially rewire your brain, Harris took a deep dive into the underreported world of CEOs, scientists, and even marines who are now using it for increased calm, focus, and happiness.\r\n\r\n10% Happier takes readers on a ride from the outer reaches of neuroscience to the inner sanctum of network news to the bizarre fringes of America’s spiritual scene, and leaves them with a takeaway that could actually change their lives",

Stoics focus on the things they can control, let go of everything else, and turn every new obstacle into an opportunity to get better, stronger, tougher.

    "description": "We live in an interesting time. Materially, everything is the best it’s ever been—we are freer, healthier and wealthier than any people in human history. Yet, somehow everything seems to be irreparably and horribly f*cked—the planet is warming, governments are failing, economies are collapsing, and everyone is perpetually offended on Twitter. At this moment in history, when we have access to technology, education and communication our ancestors couldn’t even dream of, so many of us come back to an overriding feeling of hopelessness.\r\n\r\nWhat’s going on? If anyone can put a name to our current malaise and help fix it, it’s Mark Manson. In 2016, Manson published The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck, a book that brilliantly gave shape to the ever-present, low-level hum of anxiety that permeates modern living. He showed us that technology had made it too easy to care about the wrong things, that our culture had convinced us that the world owed us something when it didn’t—and worst of all, that our modern and maddening urge to always find happiness only served to make us unhappier. Instead, the “subtle art” of that title turned out to be a bold challenge: to choose your struggle; to narrow and focus and find the pain you want to sustain. The result was a book that became an international phenomenon, selling millions of copies worldwide while becoming the #1 bestseller in 13 different countries.\r\n\r\nNow, in Everthing Is F*cked, Manson turns his gaze from the inevitable flaws within each individual self to the endless calamities taking place in the world around us. Drawing from the pool of psychological research on these topics, as well as the timeless wisdom of philosophers such as Plato, Nietzsche, and Tom Waits, he dissects religion and politics and the uncomfortable ways they have come to resemble one another. He looks at our relationships with money, entertainment and the internet, and how too much of a good thing can psychologically eat us alive. He openly defies our definitions of faith, happiness, freedom—and even of hope itself.\r\n\r\nWith his usual mix of erudition and where-the-f*ck-did-that-come-from humor, Manson takes us by the collar and challenges us to be more honest with ourselves and connected with the world in ways we probably haven’t considered before. It’s another counterintuitive romp through the pain in our hearts and the stress of our soul. One of the great modern writers has produced another book that will set the agenda for years to come.",

It explains how we become optimistic or pessimistic. It shapes our goals, our attitude toward work and relationships, and how we raise our kids, ultimately predicting whether or not we will fulfill our potential. Dweck has found that everyone has one of two basic mindsets.If you have the fixed mindset, you believe that your talents and abilities are set in stone--either you have them or you don't. You must prove yourself over and over, trying to look smart and talented at all costs. This is the path of stagnation. If you have a growth mindset, however, you know that talents can be developed and that great abilities are built over time. This is the path of opportunity--and success.Dweck demonstrates that mindset unfolds in childhood and adulthood and drives every aspect of our lives, from work to sports, from relationships to parenting.  She reveals how creative geniuses in all fields--music, literature, science, sports, business--apply the growth mindset to achieve results.  Perhaps even more important, she shows us how we can change our mindset at any stage of life to achieve true success and fulfillment.  She looks across a broad range of applications and helps parents, teachers, coaches, and executives see how they can promote the growth mindset. Highly engaging and very practical, Mindset breaks new ground as it leads you to change how you feel about yourself and your future.\"This book is an essential read for parents, teachers, coaches, and others who are instrumental in determining a child's mind-set, and in turn, his or her future success, as well as for those who would like to increase their own feelings of success and fulfillment.\" --Library JournalContentsIntroduction1.

In The Social Animal, he explored the neuroscience of human connection and how we can flourish together. Now, in The Road to Character, he focuses on the deeper values that should inform our lives. Responding to what he calls the culture of the Big Me, which emphasizes external success, Brooks challenges us, and himself, to rebalance the scales between our \"resume virtues\" -- achieving wealth, fame, and status -- and our \"eulogy virtues,\" those that exist at the core of our being: kindness, bravery, honesty, or faithfulness, focusing on what kind of relationships we have formed. Looking to some of the world's greatest thinkers and inspiring leaders, Brooks explores how, through internal struggle and a sense of their own limitations, they have built a strong inner character. Labor activist Frances Perkins understood the need to suppress parts of herself so that she could be an instrument in a larger cause. Dwight Eisenhower organized his life not around impulsive self-expression but considered self-restraint. Dorothy Day, a devout Catholic convert and champion of the poor, learned as a young woman the vocabulary of simplicity and surrender. Civil rights pioneers A. Philip Randolph and Bayard Rustin learned reticence and the logic of self-discipline, the need to distrust oneself even while waging a noble crusade. Blending psychology, politics, spirituality, and confessional, The Road to Character provides an opportunity for us to rethink our priorities, and strive to build rich inner lives marked by humility and moral depth. \"Joy,\" David Brooks writes, \"is a byproduct experienced by people who are aiming for something else. But it comes.\" - Publisher.",

When his mother allowed him the luxury of food, it was nothing more than spoiled scraps that even the dogs refused to eat. The outside world knew nothing of his living nightmare. He had nothing or no one to turn to, but his dreams kept him alive--dreams of someone taking care of him, loving him and calling him their son."

It is also the story of that young man’s relationship with his fearless, rebellious, and fervently religious mother—his teammate, a woman determined to save her son from the cycle of poverty, violence, and abuse that would ultimately threaten her own life.\r\n\r\nThe stories collected here are by turns hilarious, dramatic, and deeply affecting. Whether subsisting on caterpillars for dinner during hard times, being thrown from a moving car during an attempted kidnapping, or just trying to survive the life-and-death pitfalls of dating in high school, Trevor illuminates his curious world with an incisive wit and unflinching honesty. His stories weave together to form a moving and searingly funny portrait of a boy making his way through a damaged world in a dangerous time, armed only with a keen sense of humor and a mother’s unconventional, unconditional love.",

    "description": "\"In this candid and riveting memoir, for the first time ever, Nike founder and CEO Phil Knight shares the inside story of the company's early days as an intrepid start-up and its evolution into one of the world's most iconic, game-changing, and profitable brands. In 1962, fresh out of business school, Phil Knight borrowed $50 from his father and created a company with a simple mission: import high-quality, low-cost athletic shoes from Japan. Selling the shoes from the trunk of his lime green Plymouth Valiant, Knight grossed $8,000 his first year. Today, Nike's annual sales top $30 billion. In an age of startups, Nike is the ne plus ultra of all startups, and the swoosh has become a revolutionary, globe-spanning icon, one of the most ubiquitous and recognizable symbols in the world today. But Knight, the man behind the swoosh, has always remained a mystery. Now, for the first time, in a memoir that is candid, humble, gutsy, and wry, he tells his story, beginning with his crossroads moment. At 24, after backpacking around the world, he decided to take the unconventional path, to start his own business--a business that would be dynamic, different. Knight details the many risks and daunting setbacks that stood between him and his dream--along with his early triumphs. Above all, he recalls the formative relationships with his first partners and employees, a ragtag group of misfits and seekers who became a tight-knit band of brothers. Together, harnessing the transcendent power of a shared mission, and a deep belief in the spirit of sport, they built a brand that changed everything\"--",

At a time when America is seeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, and when societies around the world are trying to build digital-age economies, Jobs stands as the ultimate icon of inventiveness and applied imagination. He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering. Although Jobs cooperated with this book, he asked for no control over what was written nor even the right to read it before it was published. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. And Jobs speaks candidly, sometimes brutally so, about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues provide an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted. Driven by demons, Jobs could drive those around him to fury and despair. But his personality and products were interrelated, just as Apple's hardware and software tended to be, as if part of an integrated system. His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values. - Publisher.",

His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values. - Publisher."

Everest in the early afternoon of May 10,1996, he hadn't slept in fifty-seven hours and was reeling from the brain-altering effects of oxygen depletion. As he turned to begin the perilous descent from 29,028 feet (roughly the cruising altitude of an Airbus jetliner), twenty other climbers were still pushing doggedly to the top, unaware that the sky had begun to roil with clouds...Into Thin Air is the definitive account of the deadliest season in the history of Everest by the acclaimed Outside journalist and author of the bestselling Into the Wild. Taking the reader step by step from Katmandu to the mountain's deadly pinnacle, Krakauer has his readers shaking on the edge of their seat. Beyond the terrors of this account, however, he also peers deeply into the myth of the world's tallest mountain. What is is about Everest that has compelled so many poeple--including himself--to throw caution to the wind, ignore the concerns of loved ones, and willingly subject themselves to such risk, hardship, and expense? Written with emotional clarity and supported by his unimpeachable reporting, Krakauer's eyewitness account of what happened on the roof of the world is a singular achievement.From the Paperback edition.",

She was a poor black tobacco farmer whose cells—taken without her knowledge in 1951—became one of the most important tools in medicine, vital for developing the polio vaccine, cloning, gene mapping, in vitro fertilization, and more. Henrietta’s cells have been bought and sold by the billions, yet she remains virtually unknown, and her family can’t afford health insurance.\r\n\r\nThis New York Times bestseller takes readers on an extraordinary journey, from the “colored” ward of Johns Hopkins Hospital in the 1950s to stark white laboratories with freezers filled with HeLa cells, from Henrietta’s small, dying hometown of Clover, Virginia, to East Baltimore today, where her children and grandchildren live and struggle with the legacy of her cells. The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks tells a riveting story of the collision between ethics, race, and medicine; of scientific discovery and faith healing; and of a daughter consumed with questions about the mother she never knew. It’s a story inextricably connected to the dark history of experimentation on African Americans, the birth of bioethics, and the legal battles over whether we control the stuff we’re made of.\r\n([source][1])\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://rebeccaskloot.com/the-immortal-life/",

Racism intersects with class and culture and geography and even changes the way we see and value ourselves.

On Tuesday, October 9, 2012, when she was fifteen, she almost paid the ultimate price. She was shot in the head at point-blank range while riding the bus home from school, and few expected her to survive.

    "description": "*Educated* is a 2018 memoir by the American author Tara Westover. Westover recounts overcoming her survivalist Mormon family in order to go to college, and emphasizes the importance of education in enlarging her world. She details her journey from her isolated life in the mountains of Idaho to completing a PhD program in history at Cambridge University. She started college at the age of 17 having had no formal education. She explores her struggle to reconcile her desire to learn with the world she inhabited with her father.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n«Podéis llamarlo transformación. Metamorfosis. Falsedad. Traición. Yo lo llamo una educación.» Uno de los libros más importantes del año según The New York Times, que ya ha cautivado a más de medio millón de lectores. Nacida en las montañas de Idaho, Tara Westover ha crecido en armonía con una naturaleza grandiosa y doblegada a las leyes que establece su padre, un mormón fundamentalista convencido de que el final del mundo es inminente. Ni Tara ni sus hermanos van a la escuela o acuden al médico cuando enferman. Todos trabajan con el padre, y su madre es curandera y única partera de la zona. Tara tiene un talento: el canto, y una obsesión: saber. Pone por primera vez los pies en un aula a los diecisiete años: no sabe que ha habido dos guerras mundiales, pero tampoco la fecha exacta de su nacimiento (no tiene documentos). Pronto descubre que la educación es la única vía para huir de su hogar. A pesar de empezar de cero, reúne las fuerzas necesarias para preparar el examen de ingreso a la universidad, cruzar el océano y graduarse en Cambridge, aunque para ello deba romper los lazos con su familia. Westover ha escrito una historia extraordinaria -su propia historia-, una formidable epopeya, desgarradora e inspiradora, sobre la posibilidad de ver la vida a través de otros ojos, y de cambiar, que se ha convertido en un resonante éxito editorial. ** Mejor libro del año 2018 por Amazon. La crítica ha dicho...«Prodigioso libro de memorias [...] con prosa cristalina, lúcida distancia e incluso sentido del humor. [...] El dolor de esta soledad indescriptible, de la profunda herida de tener quedesgajarte de todo lo que has sido, palpita de manera estremecedora en el libro. La mayor heroicidad consiste en ser la única voz que dice basta».Rosa Montero, El País «Tara Westover ha escrito un libro único, [...] un desnudo integral, bellísimo y estremecedor. [...] Esa historia es tan grande, tan única y a la vez tan vital que se convierte en una vibrante lección de superación. Desde el aislamiento, la opresión y la ignorancia, hacia la construcción de una gran personalidad.»Berna González Harbour, El País «Westover se reconstruyó a sí misma a través de la educación, pero en su fría dulzura laten años de aislamiento salvaje que analiza con clarividencia.»Ima Sanchís, La Vanguardia «Te atrapa, te abraza, te golpea y te conmueve. Por muy distinta que sea tu vida de la de Tara, su historia nos habla a cada uno de nosotros. Es imposible salir indemne de su lectura.»Javier Ruescas «Un descarnado relato en el que muestra su metamorfosis.»Luigi Benedicto Borges, El Mundo «Una educación es aún mejor de lo que os han contado.»Bill Gates «El testimonio de quien, para contar, se deja el alma en el alambre de espino de su propia biografía.»Karina Sainz Borgo, Zenda Libros «Fascinante y desgarrador. [...] [Westover] se las ha arreglado no solo para retratar una educación de una excepcionalidad insuperable, sino también para hacer que su situación actual no parezca excepcional en absoluto.»Alec Macgillis, El Cultural de El Mundo «Testimonio desgarrador, pero sin estridencias: [...] el relato de la traumática adquisición de libertad mediante una apuesta por el conocimiento que implicó sacrificar a los suyos se ha propulsado a las listas de lo mejor del año.»CULTURAS de La Vanguardia «Un canto a la educación y el conocimiento y las posibilidades de abrir los ojos al mundo. Un texto que constituye una grata sorpresa.»Qué Leer «Ningún libro me había impactado tanto desde que hace diez o doce años quedé deslumbrado por La carretera de Cormac McCarthy.»Jaime Nubiola «La próxima vez que alguien hable de \"mormon chic\" para hablar de una blusa recatada, habría que arrojarle a la cabeza, incluso con cierta violencia, el libro de Tara Westover, para dejar de idealizar ciertos entornos.»Begoña Gómez Urzaiz, Vogue «Unas memorias que cautivan no tanto por su historia de superación heroica, que lo son, sino por la claridad con la que disecciona su propia vida.»Elena Hevia, El Periódico «Cada palabra de estas páginas es un martillazo en el clavo de una tragedia. Una versión del sueño americano, contada desde sus grietas más profundas y violentas. [...] Quien lea las páginas de Una educación asistirá a un testimonio arrancado en carne viva.»Karina Sainz Borgo, Vozpópuli «Unorthodox [...] encuentra un eco perfecto en otro relato en primera persona de una mujer que se deshizo del corsé de la religión, en este caso mormona. Una educación, de Tara Westover, es su libro.»",

[...] [Westover] se las ha arreglado no solo para retratar una educación de una excepcionalidad insuperable, sino también para hacer que su situación actual no parezca excepcional en absoluto.»Alec Macgillis, El Cultural de El Mundo «Testimonio desgarrador, pero sin estridencias: [...] el relato de la traumática adquisición de libertad mediante una apuesta por el conocimiento que implicó sacrificar a los suyos se ha propulsado a las listas de lo mejor del año.»CULTURAS de La Vanguardia «Un canto a la educación y el conocimiento y las posibilidades de abrir los ojos al mundo. Un texto que constituye una grata sorpresa.»Qué Leer «Ningún libro me había impactado tanto desde que hace diez o doce años quedé deslumbrado por La carretera de Cormac McCarthy.»Jaime Nubiola «La próxima vez que alguien hable de \"mormon chic\" para hablar de una blusa recatada, habría que arrojarle a la cabeza, incluso con cierta violencia, el libro de Tara Westover, para dejar de idealizar ciertos entornos.»Begoña Gómez Urzaiz, Vogue «Unas memorias que cautivan no tanto por su historia de superación heroica, que lo son, sino por la claridad con la que disecciona su propia vida.»Elena Hevia, El Periódico «Cada palabra de estas páginas es un martillazo en el clavo de una tragedia. Una versión del sueño americano, contada desde sus grietas más profundas y violentas. [...] Quien lea las páginas de Una educación asistirá a un testimonio arrancado en carne viva.»Karina Sainz Borgo, Vozpópuli «Unorthodox [...] encuentra un eco perfecto en otro relato en primera persona de una mujer que se deshizo del corsé de la religión, en este caso mormona. Una educación, de Tara Westover, es su libro.»"

The book is a firsthand account of Beah's time as a child soldier during the civil war in Sierra Leone (1990s). Beah was 12 years old when he fled his village after it was attacked by rebels, and he wandered the war-filled country until brainwashed by an army unit that forced him to use guns and drugs. By 13, he had perpetrated and witnessed numerous acts of violence. Three years later, UNICEF rescued him from the unit and put him into a rehabilitation program that helped him find his uncle, who would eventually adopt him.

    "description": "James Joyce's disillusion with the publication of Dubliners in 1914 was the result of ten years battling with publishers, resisting their demands to remove swear words, real place names and much else, including two entire stories. Although only 24 when he signed his first publishing contract for the book, Joyce already knew its worth: to alter it in any way would 'retard the course of civilisation in Ireland'. Joyce's aim was to tell the truth -- to create a work of art that would reflect life in Ireland at the turn of the last century. By rejecting euphemism, he would reveal to the Irish the unromantic reality, the recognition of which would lead to the spiritual liberation of the country. Each of the fifteen stories offers a glimpse of the lives of ordinary Dubliners -- a death, an encounter, an opportunity not taken, a memory rekindled -- and collectively they paint a portrait of a nation. - Back cover.\r\n\r\nDubliners is a collection of vignettes of Dublin life at the end of the 19th Century written, by Joyce’s own admission, in a manner that captures some of the unhappiest moments of life. Some of the dominant themes include lost innocence, missed opportunities and an inability to escape one’s circumstances.\r\n\r\nJoyce’s intention in writing Dubliners, in his own words, was to write a chapter of the moral history of his country, and he chose Dublin for the scene because that city seemed to him to be the centre of paralysis. He tried to present the stories under four different aspects: childhood, adolescence, maturity and public life.\r\n‘The Sisters’, ‘An Encounter’ and ‘Araby’ are stories from childhood. ‘Eveline’, ‘After the Race’, ‘Two Gallants’ and ‘The Boarding House’ are stories from adolescence. ‘A Little Cloud’, ‘Counterparts’, ‘Clay’ and ‘A Painful Case’ are all stories concerned with mature life. Stories from public life are ‘Ivy Day in the Committee Room’ and ‘A Mother and Grace’. ‘The Dead’ is the last story in the collection and probably Joyce’s greatest.

    "description": "The Prince (Italian: Il Principe [il ˈprintʃipe]; Latin: De Principatibus) is a 16th-century political treatise written by Italian diplomat and political theorist Niccolò Machiavelli as an instruction guide for new princes and royals. The general theme of The Prince is of accepting that the aims of princes – such as glory and survival – can justify the use of immoral means to achieve those ends.\r\n\r\nFrom Machiavelli's correspondence, a version appears to have been distributed in 1513, using a Latin title, De Principatibus (Of Principalities). However, the printed version was not published until 1532, five years after Machiavelli's death. This was carried out with the permission of the Medici pope Clement VII, but \"long before then, in fact since the first appearance of The Prince in manuscript, controversy had swirled about his writings\".\r\n\r\nAlthough The Prince was written as if it were a traditional work in the mirrors for princes style, it was generally agreed as being especially innovative. This is partly because it was written in the vernacular Italian rather than Latin, a practice that had become increasingly popular since the publication of Dante's Divine Comedy and other works of Renaissance literature.",

    "description": "In April 1992 a young man from a well-to-do family hitchhiked to Alaska and walked alone into the wilderness north of Mt. McKinley. His name was Christopher Johnson McCandless. He had given $25,000 in savings to charity, abandoned his car and most of his possessions, burned all the cash in his wallet, and invented a new life for himself. Four months later, his decomposed body was found by a moose hunter.  How McCandless came to die is the unforgettable story of I*nto the Wild*.\r\n\r\nImmediately after graduating from college in 1991, McCandless had roamed through the West and Southwest on a vision quest like those made by his heroes Jack London and John Muir.  In the Mojave Desert he abandoned his car, stripped it of its license plates, and burned all of his  cash.  He would give himself a new name, Alexander Supertramp, and , unencumbered by money and belongings, he would be free to wallow in the raw, unfiltered experiences that nature presented.  Craving a blank spot on the map, McCandless simply threw the maps away.  Leaving behind his desperate parents and sister, he vanished into the wild.\r\n\r\nJon Krakauer constructs a clarifying prism through which he reassembles the disquieting facts of McCandless's short life.  Admitting an interst that borders on obsession, he searches for the clues to the dries and desires that propelled McCandless.  Digging deeply, he takes an inherently compelling mystery and unravels the larger riddles it holds: the profound pull of the American wilderness on our imagination; the allure of high-risk activities to young men of a certain cast of mind; the complex, charged bond between fathers and sons.\r\n\r\nWhen McCandless's innocent mistakes turn out to be irreversible and fatal, he becomes the stuff of tabloid headlines and is dismissed for his naivete, pretensions, and hubris.  He is said  to have had a death wish but wanting to die is a very different thing from being compelled to look over the edge. Krakauer brings McCandless's uncompromising pilgrimage out of the shadows, and the peril, adversity , and renunciation sought by this enigmatic young man are illuminated with a rare understanding--and not an ounce of sentimentality. Mesmerizing, heartbreaking, *Into the Wild* is a tour de force. The power and luminosity of Jon Krakauer's stoytelling blaze through every page. From the Trade Paperback edition.",

Her life is nothing short of a miracle.”—Chicago Sun-Times\r\n\r\nThere are shelves of memoirs about overcoming the death of a parent, childhood abuse, rape, drug addiction, miscarriage, alcoholism, hustling, gangbanging, near-death injuries, drug dealing, prostitution, and homelessness.\r\n\r\nCupcake Brown survived all these things before she’d even turned twenty. \r\n\r\nAnd that’s when things got interesting. . . \r\n\r\nOrphaned by the death of her mother and left in the hands of a sadistic foster parent, young Cupcake Brown learned to survive by turning tricks, downing hard liquor, and ingesting every drug she could find while hitchhiking up and down the California coast. She stumbled into gangbanging, drug dealing, hustling, prostitution, theft, and, eventually, the best scam of all: a series of 9-to-5 jobs. \r\n\r\nA Piece of Cake is unlike any memoir you’ll ever read. Moving in its frankness, this is the most satisfying, startlingly funny, and genuinely affecting tour through hell you’ll ever take.",
